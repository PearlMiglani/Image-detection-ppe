### **Features**  
- **High-Accuracy Object Detection**: Achieves **86% precision** using YOLOv8 for reliable detection.  
- **Video Processing Support**: Upload video files, detect objects, and visualize outputs dynamically.  
- **Webcam Integration**: Enables real-time detection via webcam with efficient frame processing using OpenCV.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for uploading and processing videos.  
- **Secure File Handling**: Uses Flask-WTF for validation and session management.  
- **Streaming Capabilities**: Implements Flaskâ€™s streaming for smooth video playback during and after detection.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for routes, forms, and utilities to enhance scalability.  
- **Security Best Practices**: Validates file uploads and manages sensitive keys using environment variables.
